## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

library(knitr)

```{r}
sin(pi/4)
```
# I created a sin() function and then inside the parentheses I calculated pi/4

```{r}
x <- 10/3
```
#This code block assigns x to 10/3
#Acceptable Names: Name1, name_1, name.1, NameOne
#Unacceptable Names: Name!, Name 1, name-1
#Names may only contain numbers, letters, underscores, and periods

```{r}
MySequence <- seq(1,50,length.out=7)
```
#I assigned MySequence to a sequence of 7 evenly spaced numbers from 1 to 50

```{r}
my_vector <- c(1,5,12,31,19)
```
#I created a vector called my_vector and assigned the numbers above to it

```{r}
7 + 5 == 12
```
#I used the == comparison operator for 7+5=12. The operator checked if 7+5==12 and returned True

```{r}
(7 + 4 = 12) | (5 - 4 = 1)
```
#Error: Error in 7 + 4 = 12 : target of assignment expands to non-language object
#This code is supposed to return True if any of the arguements is correct. However it responded with an error due to using = instead of ==

```{r}
my_variable <- 10
my_varıable
```
#This code does not work because the is no dot in the i when my_variable is called
#ı vs i



```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
filter(diamond, carat > 3)
```


```{r eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

filter(mpg, cyl = 8)
filter(diamonds, carat > 3)
```
#I fixed the typo in data in line 94, filter in line 97, and diamonds in line 98
