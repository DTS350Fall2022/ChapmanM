## Explore the distribution of price

```r
ggplot(data=d,mapping=aes(x=price)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "orange",color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Price", y = "Frequency", title = "Frequency of Diamonds by Price")
```

After exploring the distribution of price, I found it quite interesting that most of the diamonds are lower in price. In fact, it is a near linear distribtuion where frequency decreases as price increases.

## What variable is most important for price?

```r
d1 <- d %>%
  select(carat,depth,table,price,x,y,z)
d2 <- cor(d1)
d2
```

### How does that variable correlat with cut?

```r
d3 <- d %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarise(carat = mean(carat))
ggplot(data = d3, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = carat)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Cut", y = "Average Carats")
```

![](CS6_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

### How is price correlated with cut?

```r
d4 <- d %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarise(price = mean(price))
ggplot(d4, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Cut", y = "Average Price")
```

![](CS6_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

After looking at the correlations between the variables, I found that carat has the strongest correlation with price. Length turned out to be the most important of the 3 (x,y,z). When comparing carat with cut, there is a small relationship where carats go down as cut quality increases. However, this relationship is very little. When comparing cut and price, there is not much of a correlation. A "Fair" cut has the second highest average price, with "Ideal" having the lowest average price. This suggests there is not any relationship with price and cut. Therefore, the relationships can lead a lopwer quality diamond to having a higher price because a low quality diamond can have a high price if the diamond has high carats.

## Carot vs Price

```r
ggplot(data=d, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cut),alpha=3/5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ylim(0, 20000)
```

## Price for Very Large vs Small Diamonds

```r
d9 <- d %>%
  arrange(carat) %>%
  mutate(perc = ntile(carat, 10)) %>%
  mutate(size = case_when(
    perc == 10 ~ "Large",
    perc == 1 ~ "Small"
  )) %>%
  group_by(size) %>%
  summarise(price = mean(price)) %>%
  drop_na()
d9
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 Ã— 2
##   size   price
##   <chr>  <dbl>
## 1 Large 12631.
## 2 Small   631.
```

```r
ggplot(d9,mapping=aes(x = size, y = price)) +
  geom_col()
```

Yes, the data does agree with my expectations. I compared the 10% largest and 10% smallest diamonds. Large diamonds had a significantly larger price.

## Combined distribution of Price, Carat, and Cut

```r
ggplot(d,mapping = aes(x = carat,y = price, color = cut)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~ cut, nrow = 2, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(x = "Carat", y = "Price", title = "Price of Diamond by Carat and Cut")
```
