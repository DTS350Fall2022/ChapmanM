```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(downloader)
library(readxl)
```

Read Data
```{r}
SoloData <- read_csv("solo-artist-followers.csv")
BillboardData <- read_csv("billboard-hits.csv")
```

Yes Data imported correctly. I had to pull from git and use read_csv because it didn't work using the git URL. It was very easy to pull from git though.


Remove singers who who do not have at least 6 times they had a top 100 hit.
```{r}
BillboardData1 <- 
  group_by(BillboardData, name) %>% 
  mutate(count = n()) %>%
  filter(count > 5) %>%
  select(name:peak_rank)
```


Find the corresponding data in the data set for the top singersâ€™ bands.
```{r}
BillboardData2 <- 
  group_by(BillboardData1, band) %>% 
  mutate(count = n()) %>%
  filter(count > 5, !is.na(band))
```

Plot
```{r}

ggplot(data = BillboardData2) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = peak_date, y = peak_rank, color = name)) +
  geom_line(aes(x= peak_date, y = peak_rank, color = name)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ band, nrow = 4, scales = "free")
```
